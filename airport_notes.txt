6/9/14
made a few changes to data merging
figured out correct way to use censored data and reporting limits with censReg
looking at residuals, breakpoints are not obvious. this is the next step


5/15/14
Now have hourly data merged with storm events. ice affected corrected. all data saved as workspace gmia_merged_data_hourly.RData.

Next:
set up to run for COD, BOD and EG+PG
run all data together, then split out residuals into different groups (different year breakpoints for pre/post)
right now using ice-affected corrected, which seems to be working fine. could switch to omitted
for EP+PG - need to check on how censored is working if one value is censored and one not. maybe add after running importQW?
for EG+PG from Steve:
 It would make sense to compute loads for both first. Use a general rule to follow when the values are censored (need to choose and estimate rather than assigning a censored load). Then add the loads
I have an idea for estimating....Develop a regression between COD and EG and between COD and PG. When values of PG or EG are censored, use COD to estimate them.
kgGlycol as forcing factor - check w/ galGlycol to make sure it's just a conversion (not total gallons product)
Plots of residuals:
pdf of several plots, with different color points for pre and post, bunch of graphs setting different marks for pre/post
boxplot of residuals pre and post
wilcox and/or t-test between final pre and post residuals
early june present to dnr
pulling bod, cod, eg, pg from qwdata - storm id is in scmfl field
daily snow - take snow depth differences from daily summary weather data and merge into hourly
Cargo and St. Lukes - figure out travel times and then run same regressions for those
final comparison - amount measured at Outfall and Cargo vs how much makes it to St. Lukes

The management happened over a period of time, beginning probably in 1998 or 1999. They increased it each year and still are working on improvements. I think the best approach might be to loop through different years as the starting point from 1998 through 2006 or so.

Another option might be to just compute the residuals of the regression, graph them as a time series, and run a smoothing curve through it to see if there is a trend. Use the "lowess" function as a start for the smoothing curve and play around with the f value varying it from about 0.1 to about 0.5 to see how it reacts.



1/14/2014 status:
Have run many different versions of regression for storms at Outfall site joined to daily loads:
* all samples w/ load data for chosen (BOD, COD, EG, PG, EGPG), all with ice affected omitted, all using mmprcp from deicing data
* all precip (no 'melt' in description), all precip w/ ice affected omitted
* all snowmelt, all snowmelt w/ ice affected omitted
* all w/o Qmax, all precip w/o Qmax, all snowmelt w/o Qmax

These are all w/ daily joined by event start and end dt, match nearest w/in 36 hours, use all of those rows to find mean, max and min temp, prcp sum, 
dwpt mean and snowdp sum
These are all run w/ total glycol application info, not split out per site

Next/further work:
Finish comparison of hourly/daily - hard to tell because of units issues
Run regressions with hourly data, similar to those done w/ Daily
Need to find out when the breakpoint is between no management system and added containment, then split into two periods
Need to run other sites - Cargo and St. Lukes
Need to re-run all with split out glycol application info
Try different ways to join data:
* daily - not use whole day? maybe part of day based on hours? but don't know when snow happened necessarily? 
* hourly - anything other than just straight event begin and end? 
* try difference in snow depth and possible conversion to snow water equivalent
* event start/end vs application start/end, precip start/end; maybe use rain vs snow description, adapt rainmaker function to look for rain/snow
* definition of deicing event - temp, precip type, airport info, etc
Document data used - QWDATA, airport figures, NCDC weather, ADAPs discharge, etc
Compare residuals for regression for "before" and "after" periods and see if they sort into a couple groups. can test significance of difference between 
these groups using Wilcox or T-test
Maybe look into local climatological data? 

End goal: to try to predict propylene glycol load based on forcing factors, using a regression (probably step-wise). Determine if there is/has been a 
significant change in loading due to management practices.possible forcing factors: application amount/dilution factor, weather, precip type and amount, 
air temperature during de-icing event, (timing of de-icing events and number of planes, no data this necessarily, may need to infer) respose variables: 
COD and BOD (surrogates for combo of all de-icers), all de-icers (pavement de-icers, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol), but some of these are more 
accurate than others.

Background: monitoring began in 1996. One station above airport, not necessary to use for this study. Numbers are so low (background levels) w/o de-icer 
that we don't need to subtract out. Two stations at airport: Outfall 7, big site that drains most of the airport de-icing runoff; cargo site drains just 
a concentrated loading area. One station downstream from the airport: St. Luke's, results of a tracer study are used to calculate lag to this site for 
de-icing events. Approx 6 events per year. Defining an 'event' will be part of the difficulty - airport info, air temp, precip, etc are options. Used to 
use a mix of propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, but switched to all propylene glycol. don't have data for degradates, will ignore that for this study. 
For management practices, they have a bladder system that is supposed to capture runoff from the stream and suck it up.
