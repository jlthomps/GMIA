Airport 

End goal: to try to predict propylene glycol load based on forcing factors, using a regression (probably step-wise). Determine if there is/has 
been a significant change in loading due to management practices.
possible forcing factors: application amount/dilution factor, weather, precip type and amount, air temperature during de-icing event, 
(timing of de-icing events and number of planes, no data this necessarily, may need to infer)
respose variables: COD and BOD (surrogates for combo of all de-icers), all de-icers (pavement de-icers, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol), 
but some of these are more accurate than others.

Background: monitoring began in 1996. One station above airport, not necessary to use for this study. Numbers are so low (background levels) w/o 
de-icer that we don't need to subtract out. Two stations at airport: Outfall 7, big site that drains most of the airport de-icing runoff; cargo 
site drains just a concentrated loading area. One station downstream from the airport: St. Luke's, results of a tracer study are used to calculate 
lag to this site for de-icing events. Approx 6 events per year. Defining an 'event' will be part of the difficulty - airport info, air temp, precip, 
etc are options. Used to use a mix of propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, but switched to all propylene glycol. don't have data for degradates, will 
ignore that for this study. For management practices, they have a bladder system that is supposed to capture runoff from the stream and suck it up. 

Questions:
management of de-icer runoff: when were changes made? more than one date? define "before" and "after"
how to infer timing of de-icing events: airport reporting, air temperature, precip type and amount, other?
how to infer load of de-icers during an event: airport reporting, number of flights at event time, size of planes, percent dilution 
(either reported or inferred from air temp), other?
how to define de-icing events for qw samples: hydrograph, same questions as above
defining event start/etc. there is the start and end of a sampling event, and of a de-icing event, and of a precip event. imp't question is, 
how far back to go from the sampling event start, and how to decide which precip is imp't for loads/etc. look at nws hourly data for descriptions 
as far as rain vs snow. can also use temp to try and infer. steve's rainmaker r function does some of this offset (goes back until hits a specified 
amount of dry period to define event start), could be expanded to look for rain vs snow.

Data: 
//projects/nonpoint/gmia/R/ for preliminary weather data and R scripts for dealing with it
//projects/nonpoint/gmia/WQ2013/ for data pulled from NWIS QWData and calculated loads
QW - much is ready, Troy will work on calculating loads for remaining events
weather - some NWIS, some NWS, need to try and get hourly air temp and precip as well as daily summaries
check out NCDC to see what else is available and may be used as a forcing variable
airport application data - have some of this, need more. they measure depth if melted for precip

Steps:
1) take a look at available data, determine holes, work with Troy on merging of data
2) experiment with a few different ways to define de-icing events (temp, precip type, airport info, etc)
3) develop regression for whole period of data, experiment with forcing factors
4) define "before" and "after" periods for de-icer management
5) compare residuals for regression for "before" and "after" periods and see if they sort into a couple groups. can test significance of difference 
between these groups using Wilcox or T-test

Air temp

GHCN Daily CoCoRaHS - not available
GHCN daily GHCN - same as GHCN daily precip
GHCN Daily WMO - NA

Question: local data hourly observations table has hourly sky conditions, visibility, dry bulb temp, wet bulb temp, dew point temp, rel humidity, 
wind speed, wind direction, wind gusts, station pressure, precip total, altimeter. does anything else have this?
